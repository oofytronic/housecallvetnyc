      "quote": "My then-20-year old cat Muffin received a death sentence almost three years ago due to cancer. My vet suggested acupuncture with Dr. Jeff Levy. My cat now 23, is still alive and enjoying his life.  He craves the weekly acupuncture treatments- often running up to Dr. Jeff on the couch, sometimes falling asleep on him. Recently, my vet celebrated Muffin's birthday and remarked that the acupuncture has played an important role in keeping him alive! I would highly recommend it!",

      "quote": "Your work gave Munchkin and myself more time together- and in fact those last couple of months were nothing short of miraculous. He could not walk, let alone sit up on his own… yet in one session you had him trotting around the apartment by himself. Please know that you have profoundly affected Munchkin’s and my life- and for that I am forever grateful.",
